    <h1>C1 Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Humbling and Bumbling </h2>
<p> <a href= "https://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> really resonated with me. I've been teaching in the tertiary education system for a long time and I feel increasingly frustrated by the consumer vs creator mindset. I'd much rather be in the kitchen with students than serving them at the table, so the possibilities of approaching education in a new way really appeal to me.</p>
<p> One of the reasons I decided to do EDA is that I wanted to master some core programming skills, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>time management</li>
  <li>work/life balance and self-care</li>
  <li>communication</li>
  <li>focus</li>
  <li>problem solving</li>
</ul>
<p> One week into the programme and I feel like I've definitely made the right decision. I've learned so much already, and it has been a humbling experience.
  I have wasted <em>hours</em> because I've' tried to go too fast and I haven't followed instructions step by step, or I haven't taken breaks when my brain is fried.
  Having spent years pretending to have all the answers, it's actually pretty liberating to be able to say "I have no idea what I'm doing".</p>
  <p> It's been a challenging week, but I've really enjoyed the work. Hours seem to fly by when I'm working through tasks or problem solving and that state of flow feels wonderful. I have a tendency to try to juggle multiple tasks at once, so being able to focus on EDA work for long stretches of time has been great.</p>
  <p> I've also enjoyed being able to work through tasks at my own pace and check in to Slack for support. I'm going to try to work at EDA for at least one day next week though, and it will be interesting to see how that goes. I have a hunch I'll be able to work a lot faster with other people to bounce things off.</p>
