    <h1>C1 Time and Habits</h1>

<p> I really enjoyed the time and habits section of the curriculum this week. I am a high skilled procrastinator and multitasker, and both of these tendencies cause me unnecessary stress.</p>
<p> I also have a tendency to get too caught up in work and forget to take breaks or exercise. To get through Phase 0 I'm really going to have to be very disciplined about time management and I need to minimise stress so that I don't burn out. </p>
<p> I like the idea of creating change through tiny habits. My aim is to use pomodoro breaks to get away from the screen and regularly do small amounts of exercise. I'm struggling to do this at the moment though. Even though I've used pomodoro before and I find it a really effective way of getting things done, I'm finding it too hard to pull myself away from a task, particularly when I'm in the middle of solving a problmen.</p>
<p> Timeboxing is another great technique, and one that goes hand in hand with pomodoro, but again, I haven't been as disciplined about this as I need to be. I've really learned the hard way this week that it does no good to keep working on a problem for too long. Everytime I've done this, I've been able to solve the problem quite quickly after a break, so I will aim to be much more careful about taking breaks next week. </p>
<p> Toggle is another really useful tool that I've used in the past, but this week I've found hard to master. I just keep forgetting to activate the timer. I also had Toggle's pomodoro setting activated, which meant the timer would regularly stop and I'd forget to reactivate it. Once I get back into the habit of Toggling, I think it will be really useful for having a more accurate insight into how much time I'm spending on tasks. In the past when I've done freelance work I found I would often underestimate my time, which is a costly mistake to make. Here I'm not billing my time, but it's still valuable.</p>
