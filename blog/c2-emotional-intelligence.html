    <h1>C2 Emotional Intelligence</h1>
<p> I read the first few chapters of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> during my morning commute, which made for a good start to the day. One of the aspects of mindfulness that I've tried to practice more recently is having a greater awareness of attention and focus. A friend who teaches yoga recently told me "wash the dishes, to wash the dishes". In other words, practice simply paying attention to the task at hand and give it your full focus. I tend to wash the dishes while listening to a podcast, drinking a glass of wine and thinking about work, so the idea of simply washing the dishes is pretty revolutionary for me. </p>
<p> I've found that EDA tasks require even great focus than doing the dishes, and I find it very easy to give my total attention to my assignments. What I tend to forget to pay attention to is myself: How am I sitting? Do I have enough light? How long has it been since I took a break? This is where I found the video on self-awareness really useful, and it's something I'm thinking about more consciously now.</p>
<p> I enjoyed the two minutes of meditation, though I haven't yet made it a habit. I did find myself practicing some of the techiques from <em>Search Inside Myself</em> while at the dentist yesterday and managed to calm myself down quite a lot through focusing on my breath and being more aware of my physical responses. </p>
