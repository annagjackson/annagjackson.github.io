                <h3>Self Confidence</h3>
                <h4>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness:</h4>
                <p> Self-awareness <em>is</em> mindfulness, although I think one could more precisely say that self-awareness is self-directed mindfulness </p>

                <p>I tried the body scan exercise outlined in Chapter Four of Search Inside Yourself. This is a concept I was familiar with from yoga, but not something I practice regularly. I was sitting in the chair that I usually sit in while working at my desk. Although I have a standing desk, I usually sit (which does sort of defeat the purpose of having a standing desk). The scanning exercise helped me to realise that although I am feeling relaxed and comfortable in this chair, it is terrible for my posture and I'm putting a lot of unnecessary strain on my back. I'm going to try a different chair and make an effort to stand more frequently. I think it would be useful to do a quick body scan from time to time to be more mindful about my posture while working. </p>

                <h4>Key takeaways from the 'My Emotions are Not Me' section:</h4>
                <p> I found this section to be very valuable. I have learned recently that when we are feeling very stressed, self-awareness is often very limited and it is easy to feel disempowered. However, by registering and acknowledging one's emotional state it is possible to exercise a little objectivity. So for example, rather than simply thinking, "I am very stressed" I can say, "I am feeling very stressed...how is this manifesting, both physically and emotionally? What is causing this stress? Is there anything I can do to a) address the cause of stress, and b) address the symptoms of stress". I have been practicing this over the past couple of months and have noticed a big improvement in my overall sense of wellbeing.</p>
