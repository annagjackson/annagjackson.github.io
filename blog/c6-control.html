                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>I started writing that programming doesn't trigger any strong emotional responses for me apart from mild frustration. Then I remembered Code Academy, when my frustration started turning into anger and there was a lot of "console.log("Code Academy sucks")" going on.</p>
                <p>In general though, it is much easier to control one's responses when engaging with a computer. Humans are trickier. I used the Siberian North Railroad exercise to mentally rehearse how I could have better responded to a situation that made me angry. At the time, my response was to remove myself from the situation physically and calm down.
                  While this was somewhat effective, I still wished I could have been more compassionate in my response as I wasn't able to completely control my emotions and my anger was apparent. I think that if I had allowed myself a moment to observe/notice and reflect I might have been able to remain calmer and have a less emotional response to the situation.</p>
                  <p>As this is a stressful time of year and I tend to get very irritable when stressed, I'm going to have plenty of opportunities to practice the Siberian North Railroad technique. When it comes to programming, I think the compassionate response is self-directed and may quite often be a simple action such as taking a short break.</p>
