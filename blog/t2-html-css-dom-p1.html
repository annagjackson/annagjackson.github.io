    <h1>Technical Blog Part 1 (Udacity Reflection)</h1>

<p> Visiting the CSS zen garden was a useful exercise, but I didn't find many sites I liked. I'm a fan of minimal design, so the site that interest me most have a very limited colour palette and clean aesthetic.
  Some of the sites I've noted are:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href= "http://www.sennep.com/"> Sennep:  </a>I like the left vertical menu, limited palette and use of lines and geometric shapes. Defintely a simple design I could emulate.</li>
      <li> <a href= "http://weaintplastic.com/"> We Ain't Plastic: </a>Some similar aspects to  Sennep, such as limited colour palette and geometric shames, combination of 3 basic colours. Nice font (Oak Light san serif) and animated headings.</li>
        <li> <a href= "http://www.guillaumejuvenet.com/#home"> Guillaume Juvenet:  </a>Side scrolling one page,with an animated graphic that is revealed by moving through pages. This is far too complicated for me right now as it uses a lot of javascript I think, but again, I like the white, grey, black palette, use of white space and very clean design.</li>
        <li> <a href= "https://ava-sessions.com/"> Ava sessions: </a>this is a very complex interactive website, and if I can ever recreate this I will be over the moon. All I'm going to take from this for now is the font (LetteraProLight,monospace).</li>
      </ul>

<h2>What is HTML, CSS and the DOM?</h2>

<p> HTML is the standardised language used to create web content.</p>
<p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language how HTML elements will be displayed. CSS allows HTML content to be easily restyled in many different ways without having to edit the HTML when an html page is linked to a style sheet.</P>
<p> The DOM (Document Object Model) is either magic or an API. A browser interprets html or xml documents in the DOM, organising elements of the document into nodes in a tree structure. The nodes are objects that can be manipulated, which I think is what gives web content the special sauce of interactivity and supports the more complex progamming function of (for example) Javascript.</p>

<h2>What is boxifying design?</h2>
<p> boxifying design simply means breaking down a design into a series of boxes in order to design CSS layout/positioning</P>

<h2>What is the box model?</h2>
<p> Every html element essentially sits inside a box, like a precious package. Inside the box is content, surrounded by a layer of padding, a border and finally, a margin. Each of these elements can be given different properties such as width, height, colour, and the combination of all these can significantly change the way an element looks and the overall design of a page.</p>
