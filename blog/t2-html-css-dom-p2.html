<h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
  <p> Dividing css layout into rows and columns in a grid layout makes positioning much easier.</p>


<h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
  <p>A responsive site will display content to fit any screen size from mobile to desktop. A responsive grid design supports this by dividing the page into percentages rather than fixed widths.</P>

<h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
  <p> Semantic structure is important in any language. English sentences, for example are typically structured subject - verb - object, e.g. Anna -learns - webdev. That sentence is less meaningful (or has a different meaning) if I rearrange the semantic structure. Likewise, HTML has many semantic elements such as h1, h2, em, href that help us to make sense of HTML. Section elements such as head, body, nav structure the document as a whole.</p>
  <p> I found <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html-5-semantics/"> this article</a> useful for explaining semantic structure and sectioning.</p>
