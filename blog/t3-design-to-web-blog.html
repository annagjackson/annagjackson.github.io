                <h3> Technical Blog: Web Design </h3>
                <p> A responsive site will display well on any device or screen size, which is incredibly important now that there are so many different kinds of screens in use. With responsive design, only one site design is required, rather than having to redesign a site for different screen sizes. </p>
                <p>Mobile first design means starting with a design that will work well on mobile (including text and button size), and then designing up from there.</p>
                <p>Frameworks providing a basis for design with basic elements already styled, generally based on a grid. Skeleton, for example uses a 12 column grid. The benefit is that the framework allows for minimal styling as only customised elements need to be added to the custom stylesheet,making design easier and, hopefully, more standards compliant. For me, the benefit of using Skeleton was that I could easily make my site responsive thanks to the framework. The downside of using a framework is that you need to learn the framework's semantic conventions and spend some time learning how to use the framework. Having just figured out how to design using a basic 12 grid system, it took me a while longer to understand how Skeleton works and which elements needed customisation.</p>
                <p>A Wireframe is a basic, boxified layout design for a website.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I used an online tool to create mine, which made it easier to visualise the grid, but I wasted too much time thinking about design when I created mine, which was totally unnecessary. In retrospect, a sketch on paper would have been perfectly fine (and much faster).</p>
