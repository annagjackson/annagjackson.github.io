                <h3>T5 Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>During sprint 5 I got stuck on the event driven DOM modification assignment, which required us to use javascript to allow a user to make changes to the colour of a board of dots on a webpage and to track and display the number of dots that display as green, blue or invisible.</P>
                  <p> I had some trouble understanding how to apply the code used to set an earlier function (start) to write a program that would count the dots. I went to Slack to see if anyone else had posted about this assignment and found that Trent and Alice has shared some snippets of their code. This helped me to see that I needed to assign the event listener given to us in the example to a variable. I also had some confusion about how to refer to the array, so seeing the example set me straight. However, even with an example, my code still wasn't working! I used the debugging tool in the DOM and that showed me that I had typed 1 instead of i and that there was something wrong with my closing bracket. After taking a break I realised I had typed classlist instead of classList and hadn't closed a statement and magically my program worked!</p>
                  <p> I have found that I often have to see a solution and then work backwards in order to understand it. I've also learned that asking for help and helping others benefits everyone. If Trent and Alice hadn't helped each other via Slack I might still be stuck!</p>

                  <h3>Problem Solving Techniques and Processes:</h3>

                   <h4>Trying something</h4>
                      <p>I've found working in the Dom is a really great way to try things out without messing up code in the editor. However, due to time constraints I'm timeboxing quite strictly. If I can't find the solution in the time I've allowed, I go looking for the answer.</p>
                   <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
                      <p>I haven't tried this while working out a problem, but from writing these blogs I can see that it's a great way to confirm and solidify understanding.</p>
                  <h4> Reading error messages</h4>
                      <p>These definitely narrow down the problem. Often I realise I've missed a bracket or made a typo thanks to an error message.</p>
                  <h4> Console.logging</h4>
                      <p>I realise now I don't really understand how to use console.log in a real environment. I'm going to have to look into this.</p>
                   <h4>Googling</h4>
                        <p>This one I've become pretty good at and use constantly. I've also found that there are a few resources that are good to go to first (such as the EDA concept resources and MDN. Eloquent Javascript is also great, but requires a bit of time).</p>
                   <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
                        <p>I haven't done this yet, partly because I'm behind, so generally someone else has asked before me. </p>
                   <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
                      <p>I haven't really had to do this either ,though there have been a few questions I've raised during check-ins and via Waffle, and it's been helpful to get direct feedback.</p>
                   <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
                   <p>These blogs are actually very helpful. I usually either discover I know more than I'd thought or there are gaps in my knowledge I need to address.</p>
